## Introduction

Software Engineering is a broad subject and encompasses many aspects including: operating systems, computer applications, 
games and many more. Through my student careerer so far, I was able to experience different subjects of software engineering.
I have been able to experience the mathematical side of software enginnering, where math was needed to determine runtime of
certain algorithms. I have also experienced the programming and code writing aspect of software engineering. From these 
experiences I was able to aquire some interests of my own.

## Interests

After taking a couple of classes, I became interested in many of the different languages. In particular I am interested in 
learning javascript. I took a scripting class and was able to scrape the surface of javascript. I am currently learning new
things from ICS 314 that I never used in my previous class. In my previous class I strictly used javascript for web based 
programming, but now I am using it in a different environment and am able to do different things. I hope to learn more uses for
javascript and hopefully can become well versed in this language.

## Skills and Experiences

From software engineering, I would like to learn more programming languages to. Learning more programming languages may 
allow me to stand out compared to others. Seeing the similarities and differences between other languages is interesting
to me. It also helps to understand similar concepts in other languages. I would like the experience of working on gaming
development. Since I play video games I would like to work on a game of my own with a team of other programmers.

## Conclusion

Although I am just starting to become immersed in software engineering, I am very interested in what software enginnering 
as to offer. I hope that in the future I will be knowledgable and be able to code in all the common languages. This is just 
the beginning and hope to learn as much as possbile out of my experience.
