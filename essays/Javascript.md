## Introduction

After completing the second week of school and getting some hands on experience from using javascript, 
I think javascript is a fun language to learn. I like using javascript because it lets me declare variables without declaring a data type.
For example in java you would declare an integer value as int num = 0;, but in javascript you can declare your integer value as let num = 0;. In javascript instead of using different data types to declare variables you can just use let or var to initialize your variables.

## Usefullness

I believe that javascript would be useful for a software engineer. Javascript is most commonly used on webpages. The programmer writes javascript code and when an html page is pulled up the javascript is sent to the broswer and the browser does something with it. So, for a software engineer the most common place they would use javascript would be working on a webpage.

## Thoughts on WODs

After completing two WODs I became aware that I was unprepared and that I need more practice. I think that having daily 
javascript "quizzes" in a sense is a good thing because it prepares the students for projects with a time limit. I believe that
doing the practice WODs helped prepare me a little, but I think I needed a bit more practice. I think the take away is that practice
and repetition will help me succeed in this class.
