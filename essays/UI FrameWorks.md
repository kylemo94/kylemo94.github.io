##Introduction

After learning about Semantic UI, I was able to understand why Semantic is useful. At first Semantic UI was difficult to grasp because I had to learn all these new commands depending on what you needed. For example different class declarations for menu bars, images, and columns. The best way to learn all these new things is by using them on your own and seeing what they do when you try to apply them. Although Semantic UI was difficult to learn, I think that it is very useful.

##Usefulness

Semantic UI allows you to have the freedom to do what you'd like in terms of customization. For me, Semantic UI allows me to style things on the webpage the way I want, without any limitations. Using raw html and Css would get the same result, but I feel like html would be more work compared to using Semantic UI. Using stricly html would create a mess of div tags that could be hard to keep track of. After learning Semantic UI I was able to more easily design a webpage than with html.

##Conclusion

I think learning Semantic UI has its benefits for a software engineer. Semantic UI is not a common thing to learn, possibly due to its learning curve. For a software Engineer, learning Semantic UI will make coding a webpage easier, in my own opinion. I am glad that I had the experience of using Semantic UI because of its easy access and customization options. Hopefully others will read this and take a dive into Semantic UI.
