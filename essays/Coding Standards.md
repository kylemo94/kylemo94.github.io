# Introduction

After using ESLint and IntelliJ, this past week, I think IntelliJ is a fairly easy to use system. The coding standards
implemented by ESLint are easy to find by using IntelliJ. I didn't have too many problems with using these two together, but
the problems that I did have were on the setup of IntelliJ and getting everything to work together. After I took the time to sort
out the tiny problems I had, IntelliJ was easy to use and navigate. 

# Importance of coding standards

I think that implementing coding standards are important. By learning coding standards it gets you to write code in a certain 
pattern, so that everytime you are writing code, you will be following that same guideline and won't miss anything or 
incorrectly type something. I also believe that learning coding standards helps learn a language. A specific example from my own
experience is, when I first started using ESLint and IntelliJ. I would write let to declare some variables and ESLint would tell me
that the variable is not changing throughout the program, so instead told me to use const to declare those specific variables. This 
helped me learn the difference between using let and const variable declarations and which situations to use these in.

# Conclusion

In the beginning using ESLint was a hassle because of all the red marks I had on my program. Once I learned how to format my
coding, then it didn't seem like too much of a problem. I believe that if you practice using the coding standards enough, then you
will be proficient enough to have minimal mistakes when writing programs with that same coding standard. Through this experience I 
enjoy learning this coding standard, becuase it teaches me to write my code with the coding standards in mind and helps me understand
the coding language better.
