## Introduction
I've been working at Subway for a while now and I think that the use of design patterns relates closely to the sandwich making process. My design pattern process consists of two steps. I first think about the layout and how I want the program to look when someone uses the app. The second step is working on the functionality of that program. This relates to sandwich making because the layout is the bread of the sandwich and the functionality is everything else inside the sandwich.

## Layout:Bread
How is the layout like the bread of the sandwich? Well you can't really have any functionality without having something interactive on the app. For example you first have to create the button in order to make the button do something. Yes, there are some onload functions that you could use, but other than that, the layout or skeletons must first be created. This is like the bread of a sandwich because you first have to bake the bread before you even start putting together the sandwich.

## Functionality:Meat, Veggies & Condiments
