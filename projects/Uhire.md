## Background
This program was created with the intention of linking students and companies together. The students are able to look for companies that they are interested in and apply for the positions that they are qualified for. The companies can look at the student profiles and contact the students if they are interested. The students are able to search for companies using interest tags as well as by company name, while the companies can search for students by last name and interest tags. 

## Experience
I worked on the validation of the forms on our page as well as the student homepage and admin homepage. The student homepage was later combined with another page because the two pages seemed like they would go together. On my form validations I used different event handlers depending on what I wanted the event handler to do. By completing this project I learned different ways to use the event handlers as well as learn how to use the autoform validation. This was important to me because this was something that was not previously touched on in class and had to do some research about to apply it properly.

Here is an example of the form validation.
